# Output Files in DIV3D

This page describes the common output files generated by a run of DIV3D.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Primary Output Files

| Filename | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `allparts.out` | Final endpoints of all traced field lines after diffusion phase. |
| `hitline.out` | Sampled points along traced field lines that hit geometry; used for visualizing impact locations. |
| `hitcount.out` | Histogram of hit frequency per triangle or surface region. |
| `int_pts.out` | Exact points of intersection between field lines and geometry surfaces. |
| `surface_line.out` | Traced field lines on magnetic surfaces (if `trace_surface_opt = .true.`). |
| `part_triangles.out` | Indexes of geometry triangles hit by field lines. |
| `part_triangle_mids.out` | Midpoints of triangles hit by field lines. |

## ðŸ”¹ Launch and Diagnostic Outputs

| Filename | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `launch_pts.out` | Coordinates of the launch points used to start field line tracing. |
| `partX.part` | Files containing triangle mesh data for each part; used as geometry input but also post-processed for visualization. |

These files are written in plain ASCII and can be parsed using tools like Python, MATLAB, or ParaView (with conversion).
